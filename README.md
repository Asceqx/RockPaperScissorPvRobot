# Robot vs Human: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a decentralized Rock Paper Scissors game where a human can play against a robot. The game uses a Move-based smart contract for the backend, while the frontend is built with React.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React to create a user-friendly interface for players.
- **Blockchain**: The game runs on a decentralized blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Robot Opponent**: Play against a bot that selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors randomly.
- **Human Interaction**: Users can connect their wallets, make a move, and challenge the bot.

## Technology Stack

- **Move**: Smart contract language for blockchain logic.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
