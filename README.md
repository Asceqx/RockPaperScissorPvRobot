# Robot vs Human: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a decentralized Rock Paper Scissors game where a human can play against a robot. The game uses a Move-based smart contract for the backend, while the frontend is built with React.

## Features

- **Smart Contract**: Written in Move, handling the game logic on-chain.
- **Frontend**: Built with React to create a user-friendly interface for players.
- **Blockchain**: The game runs on a decentralized blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Robot Opponent**: Play against a bot that selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors randomly.
- **Human Interaction**: Users can connect their wallets, make a move, and challenge the bot.

## Technology Stack

- **Move**: Smart contract language for blockchain logic.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Aptos**: The blockchain network used for deploying the game.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For the frontend development.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** and **npm** or **yarn** installed.
2. A wallet that supports the Aptos network.
3. A local blockchain node or access to a testnet.

## Game Rules
Both the human and robot make their choices from Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
The smart contract verifies the moves and determines the winner.
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
The result is displayed on the frontend.

## Future Scope and Vision
This project is currently a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but it has significant potential for expansion:

Advanced AI for the Robot:

Develop a more intelligent bot that learns player patterns and improves its choices.
Multiplayer Mode:

Allow human players to compete against each other in real-time by connecting their wallets and interacting with the smart contract.
Leaderboard and Rankings:

Implement a ranking system where players can track their progress, wins, and losses globally.
Token Integration:

Introduce a tokenized reward system where players can earn crypto tokens for winning games.
Mobile App:

Develop a mobile version of the game for a seamless experience on smartphones.
Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:

Explore the potential of integrating AR to make the gameplay more immersive, especially on mobile devices.
NFT-based Customization:

Players can customize their in-game avatars or objects with NFTs, making the game more engaging.
